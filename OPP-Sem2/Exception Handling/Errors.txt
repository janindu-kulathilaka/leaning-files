Errors

    -Causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result
    -Causes it to behave in unitended  ways.


Terminologies

    - A mistake in the code is called **Error**
    - Error found by tester is called **Defect**
    - Defect accepted by development team is called **Bug**
    - And the program does not meet the requirements then it is **Faliure**


Type of Errors

    1. Syntax Errors - Shows by IDE
    2. Logic Errors - BlackBox and WhiteBox (Testing Types)
    3. Compilation Errors - Compiler shows the Error
    4. Run time Errors - Defensive Programming
    5. Arithmetic Errors - BlackBox and WhiteBox
    6. Resource Errors - stress test
    7. Interface Errors - 


Defensive Programming

1. Defensive Programming
    - Specificaitons
    - Modularize
    - Conditions

2. Testing/ Validation
    - Compare
    - "It's not working!"
    - "How can I break my program?"

3. Debugging
    - Study events
    - "Why is it not working?"
    - "How can I fix my program?"


Why Exception Handling?

    - Separation of Error Handling code from Normal code
    - Functions/Methods can handle any exceptions they choose
    - Grouping of Error Types
